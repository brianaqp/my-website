    <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
      Hi! I'm Brian. I started my journey in technology as a kid, always messing around with computers. That passion led me to finish a bachelor's degree in Mechatronics Engineering, where I discovered a strong interest in software development.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
      I began experimenting with Python scripts, online tutorials, and more. Later, I got my first job as a Software Engineer at a Shipping Agency, helping translate old applications into better software for faster and safer delivery. There, I gained hands-on experience in real-world projects, using Python for desktop development and NodeJS + Angular for web applications.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
      After completing those projects, I wanted to push myself further and break away from working alone. I attended a bootcamp in Tokyo, Japan—an eye-opening experience where I made lasting friendships, learned to work in teams, and ignited my passion for software development.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      Now, I'm actively looking for my next opportunity, excited to contribute, learn, and keep growing as a developer and as a person.
